# CreditCardFraudDetector
My first project in machine learning and it is about credit card fraud. This project was first for many things for me. Almost every libraries and their functions.
The subject of the project was kind of popular topic. I have chosen it because I need some sources in this project.
This project really helped me to understand machine learning and python libraries. By the way thanks to BTKAkademi for their support and interest.
